# Protect-Your-API
This project is a starting point for a TypeScript based React app that also has a local API server using express.

There are 2 different Webpack configurations. One for the server and one for the client.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Configurations

#### ***Privileges***
create user 'auth_samp'@'localhost' identified by '(your password)';<br />
grant all privileges on auth_samp.* to 'auth_samp'@'localhost';
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## DDLs

#### ***Blogs Table***

CREATE TABLE Blogs (
id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
content longtext,
title varchar(60) DEFAULT NULL,
_created DATETIME NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

INSERT INTO `auth_samp`.`Blogs`
(`title`, `content`)
VALUES

"The 33-year-old has spent his entire career at Camp Nou, winning the Ballon d'Or on six occasions - but now looks set to leave
  Lionel Messi has demanded to leave Barcelona by activating a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave on a free transfer.
  
  The 33-year-old has sent a fax to Barcelona communicating his intention to leave behind the club he's played at for 20 years.
  
  Although his contract is set to expire at the end of the 2020-21 season, Messi and his legal team believe the clause will allow him to terminate his deal unilaterally.");

  "The Manchester United defender will not take part in upcoming Nations League matches after initially being called in
   The FA has announced that Gareth Southgate has dropped Harry Maguire from the latest England squad after the Manchester United star was found guilty of charges of aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and repeated attempts of bribery on Tuesday.
   
   Maguire's sentencing came just hours after he was initially named to England's latest squad for Septemberâ€™s Nations League games against Iceland and Denmark, with Southgate explaining that he had spoken to Maguire and was working on what information he was presented.
   
   But Maguire was subsequently dropped after being handed a 21-month suspended prison sentence after an incident in Greece last week, with the defender, his brother Joe Maguire and their friend Christopher Sharman all found guilty after a trial in Syros, Greece.");

      The Netherlands international was forced off in the 55th minute of the Reds' 2-2 draw in Austria after suffering a cut to his head.

## Server
The server build process compiles the TypeScript files found in `/src/server` into a single bundled JavaScript file located in the `/dist` directory.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


## Client
The client build process compiles the React app located in `/src/client` into a bundled located at `/public/js/app.js`.

The client configuration will also build the Sass files found at `/src/client/scss`. The App component imports the `app.scss` file which already includes an import for Bootstrap.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


## Running the project
In order to run the server, use `npm run dev`, and the server will start on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). 

Webpack will watch the files. Once you save a file, you can refresh your browser to ensure you got the updated client files. If you only change server files, you *shouldn't* need to refresh.
